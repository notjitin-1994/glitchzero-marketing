        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing or using the services, websites, and applications (collectively, the "Services") offered by GlitchZero ("we", "us", or "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Services</h2>
        <p>
          GlitchZero provides custom digital solutions, including but not limited to, website development, mobile application development, desktop software, and ongoing maintenance. All services are governed by a project-specific Statement of Work (SOW), which will be mutually agreed upon before any work commences. The SOW will detail the scope, timelines, deliverables, and fees for the project.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Payments and Fees</h2>
        <p>
          Fees for our Services will be clearly outlined in the SOW. A non-refundable upfront deposit is typically required to initiate a project. The remaining balance is due upon project completion and delivery, or as otherwise specified in the SOW. All payments must be made in accordance with the payment schedule. Failure to make timely payments may result in work stoppage or project termination.
        </p>
        
        <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Upon our receipt of full and final payment, you, the client, will own the intellectual property rights for the final, delivered code and designs specific to your project. We retain ownership of all our pre-existing proprietary tools, frameworks, AI systems, and source code used in the development process. We also reserve the right to display the project in our portfolio and marketing materials, unless a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is executed and states otherwise.
        </p>
        
        <h2>5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to provide all necessary information, materials (e.g., text, images), and feedback in a timely manner to facilitate the project's progress. Delays in providing these materials may result in project timeline extensions. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and permissions for any materials you provide to us.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
          Both parties agree to treat all non-public information received from the other party as confidential. This includes business strategies, client lists, project details, and proprietary information. This obligation of confidentiality will survive the termination of our engagement.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, GlitchZero shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the services; (b) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers and/or any personal information stored therein. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services is limited to the amount paid by you for the Services in the preceding 12 months.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party commits a material breach of these Terms and fails to cure such breach within 14 days of written notice. Upon termination, you are required to pay for all work completed up to the date of termination. We may suspend or terminate access to our Services immediately, without prior notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users of our Services, us, or third parties.
        </p>
        
        <h2>9. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India, with jurisdiction in the courts of Bengaluru, Karnataka. Both parties agree to first attempt to resolve any disputes amicably through negotiation.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. By continuing to access or use our Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
        </p>
