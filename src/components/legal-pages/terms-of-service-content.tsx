        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By using the services, websites, and applications (collectively, the "Services") offered by GlitchZero ("we", "us", or "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Services</h2>
        <p>
          GlitchZero provides custom digital solutions, including but not limited to, website development, mobile and desktop application development, and software maintenance. All services provided are detailed in a project-specific Statement of Work (SOW), which will be agreed upon by both parties before work commences.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Payments</h2>
        <p>
          Fees for our Services will be outlined in the SOW. Typically, we require an upfront deposit before work begins, with the balance due upon completion and delivery of the project. All payments are non-refundable once work has commenced.
        </p>
        
        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          Upon full and final payment, you, the client, will own the intellectual property for the final, delivered project. We reserve the right to use the project for our portfolio and marketing materials unless otherwise specified in the SOW. We retain ownership of all our proprietary tools, frameworks, and AI systems used in the development process.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, GlitchZero shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the services; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the services.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may terminate or suspend your access to our Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Services will immediately cease.
        </p>
        
        <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms of Service on this page.
        </p>
